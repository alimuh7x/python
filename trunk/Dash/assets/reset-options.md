# Reset Button Styling Checklist

- [ ] Keep dimensions at `34px × 32px` for consistency with numeric inputs.
- [ ] Use `#0f2244` border with 1.5px weight and transparent fill.
- [ ] Apply subtle shadow `0 2px 4px rgba(15, 27, 43, 0.12)` for depth.
- [ ] Tint the icon with the blue filter `brightness(0) saturate(100%) invert(17%) sepia(32%) saturate(1432%) hue-rotate(189deg) brightness(88%) contrast(94%)`.
- [ ] Add hover lift (`translateY(-1px)`) and stronger shadow.
- [ ] Add pressed state with reduced shadow to imply click feedback.

Tick the options you want, save the file, and I’ll implement accordingly.***
